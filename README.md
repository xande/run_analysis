Assignment Week 3 - Getting and Cleaning Data Course

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. the data is collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. 

There are two files in thsi repo:

* run_analysis.R
* CodeBook.md

##run_analysis.R

This file downlods raw data, process the files and then saves processed data sets on the disk.

This file: 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


##CodeBook.md

This file contains information about resulting data sets.
